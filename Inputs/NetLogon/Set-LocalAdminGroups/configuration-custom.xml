            Sources allow the script to identify which object is belonging to which Tier/Source. you can add as many as you need. 

            Important: YOU DON'T NEED TO ADD THE DOMAIN DN.
            
            All source will be crawled and compared to the distinguishedName of the computer object ; first match wins. To ease in setting up the dnPattern, you can try in pShell with the following command (should return True):
            PS:> (Get-ADComputer MyComputer).DistinguishedName -match $dnPattern

            Filling up osPattern will instruct the script to confirm a target only if the osPattern is matched; if not used, just fill it up with ".*". You can test the osPattern match this way:
            PS:> (Get-ADComputer MyComputer -Properties OperatingSystem).OperatingSystem -match $osPattern

            When you fillup the 'target' attribute, you need to refer to a sub-section of <targets>. This way you can fine tune your script and manage exception. 
            If the sub-section is missing, <default><target> will be used.

            LegacyTarget teach the script to use an alternate target when a legacy system is detected. the value must match a sub-section of <targets>; if not, the parameter target will be used anyway.

            The default section (dnPattern=".*"), if kept, must remains at the whole end of this section - else all analyse will fall into it. Note: we have to keep it, as it will redirect to default values.
