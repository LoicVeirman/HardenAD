      <string id="CustomLocalesNoSelect_Help">This policy setting prevents a user from selecting a supplemental custom locale as their user locale. The user is restricted to the set of locales that are installed with the operating system.

This does not affect the selection of replacement locales. To prevent the selection of replacement locales, adjust the permissions of the %windir%\Globalization directory to prevent the installation of locales by unauthorized users.

The policy setting "Restrict user locales" can also be enabled to disallow selection of a custom locale, even if this policy setting is not configured.

If you enable this policy setting, the user cannot select a custom locale as their user locale, but they can still select a replacement locale if one is installed.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the user can select a custom locale as their user locale.

If this policy setting is enabled at the machine level, it cannot be disabled by a per-user policy setting. If this policy setting is disabled at the machine level, the per-user policy setting will be ignored. If this policy setting is not configured at the machine level, restrictions will be based on per-user policy settings.

To set this policy setting on a per-user basis, make sure that you do not configure the per-machine policy setting.

      <string id="Y2K_Help">This policy setting determines how programs interpret two-digit years.

This policy setting affects only the programs that use this Windows feature to interpret two-digit years. If a program does not interpret two-digit years correctly, consult the documentation or manufacturer of the program.

If you enable this policy setting, the system specifies the largest two-digit year interpreted as being preceded by 20. All numbers less than or equal to the specified value are interpreted as being preceded by 20. All numbers greater than the specified value are interpreted as being preceded by 19.

For example, the default value, 2029, specifies that all two-digit years less than or equal to 29 (00 to 29) are interpreted as being preceded by 20, that is 2000 to 2029. Conversely, all two-digit years greater than 29 (30 to 99) are interpreted as being preceded by 19, that is, 1930 to 1999.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Windows does not interpret two-digit year formats using this scheme for the program.</string>

      <string id="ImplicitDataCollectionOff_Help">
        This policy setting turns off the automatic learning component of handwriting recognition personalization. 

		Automatic learning enables the collection and storage of text and ink written by the user in order to help adapt handwriting recognition to the vocabulary and handwriting style of the user. 

		Text that is collected includes all outgoing messages in Windows Mail, and MAPI enabled email clients, as well as URLs from the Internet Explorer browser history. The information that is stored includes word frequency and new words not already known to the handwriting recognition engines (for example, proper names and acronyms). Deleting email content or the browser history does not delete the stored personalization data. Ink entered through Input Panel is collected and stored.  

		Note: Automatic learning of both text and ink might not be available for all languages, even when handwriting personalization is available. See Tablet PC Help for more information.

		If you enable this policy setting, automatic learning stops and any stored data is deleted. Users cannot configure this setting in Control Panel.

		If you disable this policy setting, automatic learning is turned on. Users cannot configure this policy setting in Control Panel. Collected data is only used for handwriting recognition, if handwriting personalization is turned on.

		If you do not configure this policy, users can choose to enable or disable automatic learning either from the Handwriting tab in the Tablet Settings in Control Panel or from the opt-in dialog.

		This policy setting is related to the "Turn off handwriting personalization" policy setting.

		Note: The amount of stored ink is limited to 50 MB and the amount of text information to approximately 5 MB. When these limits are reached and new data is collected, old data is deleted to make room for more recent data.

		Note: Handwriting personalization works only for Microsoft handwriting recognizers, and not with third-party recognizers.</string>

        If the policy is Enabled, then the user will get input methods enabled for the system account on the sign-in page.
