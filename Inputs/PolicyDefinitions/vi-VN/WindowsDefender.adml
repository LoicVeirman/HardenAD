      2. Proxy .pac URL (if specified)
      3. None
      4. Internet Explorer proxy settings
      5. Autodetect

      If you enable this setting, the proxy setting will be set to use the specified proxy .pac according to the order specified above.

    <string id="Nis_Consumers_IPS_DisableSignatureRetirement_Explain">This policy setting allows you to configure definition retirement for network protection against exploits of known vulnerabilities. Definition retirement checks to see if a computer has the required security updates necessary to protect it against a particular vulnerability. If the system is not vulnerable to the exploit detected by a definition, then that definition is "retired". If all security intelligence for a given protocal are retired then that protocol is no longer parsed. Enabling this feature helps to improve performance. On a computer that is up-to-date with all the latest security updates, network protection will have no impact on network performance.

    If you enable or do not configure this setting, definition retirement will be enabled.

    You can choose to send basic or additional information about detected software. Additional information helps Microsoft create new security intelligence and help it to protect your computer. This information can include things like location of detected items on your computer if harmful software was removed. The information will be automatically collected and sent. In some instances, personal information might unintentionally be sent to Microsoft. However, Microsoft will not use this information to identify you or contact you.

    Possible options are:

      The typical cloud check timeout is 10 seconds. To enable the extended cloud check feature, specify the extended time in seconds, up to an additional 50 seconds.

      For example, if the desired timeout is 60 seconds, specify 50 seconds in this setting, which will enable the extended cloud check feature, and will raise the total time to 60 seconds.
