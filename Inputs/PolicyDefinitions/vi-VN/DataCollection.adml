      <string id="AllowTelemetry">Allow Diagnostic Data</string>
      <string id="AllowTelemetry_0">Diagnostic data off (not recommended)</string>
      <string id="AllowTelemetry_1">Send required diagnostic data</string>
      <string id="AllowTelemetry_3">Send optional diagnostic data</string>
      <string id="AllowTelemetry_Explain">By configuring this policy setting you can adjust what diagnostic data is collected from Windows. This policy setting also restricts the user from increasing the amount of diagnostic data collection via the Settings app. The diagnostic data collected under this policy impacts the operating system and apps that are considered part of Windows and does not apply to any additional apps installed by your organization.

    - Diagnostic data off (not recommended). Using this value, no diagnostic data is sent from the device. This value is only supported on Enterprise, Education, and Server editions.
    - Send required diagnostic data. This is the minimum diagnostic data necessary to keep Windows secure, up to date, and performing as expected. Using this value disables the "Optional diagnostic data" control in the Settings app.
    - Send optional diagnostic data. Additional diagnostic data is collected that helps us to detect, diagnose and fix issues, as well as make product improvements. Required diagnostic data will always be included when you choose to send optional diagnostic data.  Optional diagnostic data can also include diagnostic log files and crash dumps. Use the "Limit Dump Collection" and the "Limit Diagnostic Log Collection" policies for more granular control of what optional diagnostic data is sent.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the device will send required diagnostic data and the end user can choose whether to send optional diagnostic data from the Settings app.

Note:
The "Configure diagnostic data opt-in settings user interface" group policy can be used to prevent end users from changing their data collection settings.
      </string>

      <string id="TelemetryProxy">Configure Connected User Experiences and Telemetry</string>

If you enable this policy setting, you can specify the FQDN or IP address of the destination device within your organization's network (and optionally a port number, if desired). The connection will be made over a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection.  If the named proxy fails, or if you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Connected User Experience and Telemetry data will be sent to Microsoft using the default proxy configuration.

The format for this setting is &lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt; 
      </string>

      <string id="CommercialId">Configure the Commercial ID</string>
      <string id="CommercialId_Explain">This policy setting defines the identifier used to uniquely associate this deviceâ€™s diagnostic data data as belonging to a given organization. If your organization is participating in a program that requires this device to be identified as belonging to your organization then use this setting to provide that identification. The value for this setting will be provided by Microsoft as part of the onboarding process for the program. 

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, then Microsoft will not be able to use this identifier to associate this machine and its diagnostic data data with your organization.
