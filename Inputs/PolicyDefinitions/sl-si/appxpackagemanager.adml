      <string id="AppxDeploymentAllowAllTrustedApps">Allow all trusted apps to install</string>
      <string id="AppxDeploymentAllowAllTrustedAppsExplanation">This policy setting allows you to manage the installation of trusted line-of-business (LOB) Windows Store apps.

If you enable this policy setting, you can install any LOB Windows Store app (which must be signed with a certificate chain that can be successfully validated by the local computer).

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, you cannot install LOB Windows Store apps.</string>
      <string id="AllowDeploymentInSpecialProfiles">Allow deployment operations in special profiles</string>
      <string id="AllowDeploymentInSpecialProfilesExplanation">This policy setting allows you to manage the deployment of Windows Store apps when the user is signed in using a special profile. Special profiles are the following user profiles, where changes are discarded after the user signs off:

Roaming user profiles to which the "Delete cached copies of roaming profiles" Group Policy setting applies

Mandatory user profiles and super-mandatory profiles, which are created by an administrator

Temporary user profiles, which are created when an error prevents the correct profile from loading

User profiles for the Guest account and members of the Guests group


If you enable this policy setting, Group Policy allows deployment operations (adding, registering, staging, updating, or removing an app package) of Windows Store apps when using a special profile.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Group Policy blocks deployment operations of Windows Store apps when using a special profile.</string>
      <string id="AllowDevelopmentWithoutDevLicense">Allow development of Windows Store apps without installing a developer license </string>
      <string id="AllowDevelopmentWithoutDevLicenseExplanation">
        Allows or denies development of Windows Store applications without installing a developer license.

        If you enable this setting and enable the "Allow all trusted apps to install" Group Policy, you can develop Windows Store apps without installing a developer license.
        
        If you disable or do not configure this setting, you'll need to install a developer license before you can develop Windows Store apps.
