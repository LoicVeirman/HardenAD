If you disable this policy or do not configure it, these controls will not be designated as administrator-approved.

To specify how administrator-approved controls are handled for each security zone, carry out the following steps:

1. In Group Policy, click User Configuration, click Internet Explorer Maintenance, and then click Security.

2. Double-click Security Zones and Content Ratings, click Import the Current Security Zones Settings, and then click Modify Settings.

If you enable this policy setting, ActiveX Filtering is enabled by default for the user. The user cannot turn off ActiveX Filtering, although they may add per-site exceptions.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, ActiveX Filtering is not enabled by default for the user. The user can turn ActiveX Filtering on or off.</string>
      <string id="IE_ExplainAddonManagement_AddOnList">This policy setting allows you to manage a list of add-ons to be allowed or denied by Internet Explorer. Add-ons in this case are controls like ActiveX Controls, Toolbars, and Browser Helper Objects (BHOs) which are specifically written to extend or enhance the functionality of the browser or web pages.

This list can be used with the 'Deny all add-ons unless specifically allowed in the Add-on List' policy setting, which defines whether add-ons not listed here are assumed to be denied.

If you enable this policy setting, you can enter a list of add-ons to be allowed or denied by Internet Explorer. For each entry that you add to the list, enter the following information:

Name of the Value - the CLSID (class identifier) for the add-on you wish to add to the list.  The CLSID should be in brackets for example, ‘{000000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000000}'. The CLSID for an add-on can be obtained by reading the OBJECT tag from a Web page on which the add-on is referenced.

Value - A number indicating whether Internet Explorer should deny or allow the add-on to be loaded. To specify that an add-on should be denied enter a 0 (zero) into this field. To specify that an add-on should be allowed, enter a 1 (one) into this field. To specify that an add-on should be allowed and also permit the user to manage the add-on through Add-on Manager, enter a 2 (two) into this field.

If you disable this policy setting, the list is deleted. The 'Deny all add-ons unless specifically allowed in the Add-on List' policy setting will still determine whether add-ons not in this list are assumed to be denied.</string>
      <string id="IE_ExplainAddonManagement_ManagementMode">This policy setting allows you to ensure that any Internet Explorer add-ons not listed in the 'Add-on List' policy setting are denied. Add-ons in this case are controls like ActiveX Controls, Toolbars, and Browser Helper Objects (BHOs) which are specifically written to extend or enhance the functionality of the browser or web pages.

By default, the 'Add-on List' policy setting defines a list of add-ons to be allowed or denied through Group Policy. However, users can still use the Add-on Manager within Internet Explorer to manage add-ons not listed within the 'Add-on List' policy setting. This policy setting effectively removes this option from users - all add-ons are assumed to be denied unless they are specifically allowed through the 'Add-on List' policy setting.

If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer only allows add-ons that are specifically listed (and allowed) through the 'Add-on List' policy setting.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users may use Add-on Manager to allow or deny any add-ons that are not included in the 'Add-on List' policy setting.

Note: If an add-on is listed in the 'Add-on List' policy setting, the user cannot change its state through Add-on Manager (unless its value has been set to allow user management - see the 'Add-on List' policy for more details).</string>

      <string id="IE_ExplainAddonManagement_RestrictExtensionManagement">This policy setting allows you to manage whether users have the ability to allow or deny add-ons through Add-On Manager.

If you enable this policy setting, users cannot enable or disable add-ons through Add-On Manager. The only exception occurs if an add-on has been specifically entered into the 'Add-On List' policy setting in such a way as to allow users to continue to manage the add-on. In this case, the user can still manage the add-on through the Add-On Manager.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the appropriate controls in the Add-On Manager will be available to the user.</string>
      <string id="IE_ExplainAddSearchProvider">This policy setting allows you to add a specific list of search providers to the user's default list of search providers. Normally, search providers can be added from third-party toolbars or in Setup. The user can also add a search provider from the provider's website.

If you enable this policy setting, the user can add and remove search providers, but only from the set of search providers specified in the list of policy keys for search providers (found under [HKCU or HKLM\Software\policies\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\SearchScopes]). Note: This list can be created from a custom administrative template file.

For example, when there is a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request for .jpg files, on receipt are generally displayed to the user in an Internet Explorer window. If Internet Explorer receives an executable file, Internet Explorer generally prompted the user for how to handle the file.

In Windows XP Service Pack 2, Internet Explorer follows stricter rules that are designed to reduce the attack surface for spoofing the Internet Explorer MIME-handling logic.

When files are served to the client, Internet Explorer uses the following pieces of information to decide how to handle the file:

- File name extension
- Content-Type from the HTTP header (MIME type)
- Content-Disposition from the HTTP header
- Results of the MIME sniff

In Windows XP Service Pack 2, Internet Explorer requires that all file-type information that is provided by Web servers is consistent. For example, if the MIME type of a file is "text/plain" but the MIME sniff indicates that the file is really an executable file, Internet Explorer renames the file by saving the file in the Internet Explorer cache and changes its extension.

      <string id="IESF_ExplainProtectionFromZoneElevationCategory">When a Web page is opened in Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer puts restrictions on what the page can do, based on where that Web page came from: the Internet, a local intranet server, a trusted site, and so on. For example, pages on the Internet have stricter security restrictions than pages on a user's local intranet. Web pages on a user's computer are in the Local Machine security zone, where they have the fewest security restrictions. This makes the Local Machine security zone a prime target for malicious users. Zone Elevation Blocks makes it harder to get code to run in this zone. (As a separate feature, Local Machine Zone Lockdown makes the zone less vulnerable to malicious users by changing its security settings.)

Internet Explorer prevents the overall security context for any link on a page from being higher than the security context of the root URL. This means, for example, that a page in the Internet zone cannot navigate to a page in the Local Intranet zone, except as the result of a user-initiated action. A script, for example, could not cause this navigation. For the purpose of this mitigation, the security context ranking of the zones, from highest security context to lowest, is: Restricted Sites zone, Internet zone, Local Intranet zone, Trusted Sites zone, and Local Machine zone.

Zone Elevation also disables JavaScript navigation if there is no security context.

      <string id="IESF_ExplainScriptedWindowSecurityRestrictionsCategory">Internet Explorer provides the capability for scripts to programmatically open additional windows of various types, and to resize and reposition existing windows. The Window Restrictions security feature restricts two types of script-initiated windows that have been used by malicious persons to deceive users: popup windows (which do not have components such as the address bar, title bar, status bar, and toolbars) and windows that include the title bar and status bar.

Script-initiated windows with the title bar and status bar are constrained in scripted movement to ensure that these important and informative bars remain visible after the operation completes.

- Scripts cannot position windows so that the title bar or address bar are above the visible top of the display.
- Scripts cannot position windows such that the status bar is below the visible bottom of the display.
- Script-initiated windows that include a title bar and status bar are constrained in scripted sizing to ensure that the title bar and status bar remain visible after the operation completes.
- Scripts cannot resize windows such that the title bar, address bar, or status bar cannot be seen.
- When creating a window, the definition of the fullscreen=yes specification is changed to mean "show the window as maximized," which will keep the title bar, address bar, and status bar visible.

Internet Explorer has been modified to not turn off the status bar for any windows. The status bar is always visible for all Internet Explorer windows.

Script-initiated popup windows are now constrained so that they:

- Do not extend above the top or below the bottom of the parent Internet Explorer Web Object Control (WebOC) window.
- Are smaller in height than the parent WebOC window.
- Overlap the parent window horizontally.
- Stay with the parent window if the parent window moves.

Internet Explorer has 4 security zones, numbered 1-4, and these are used by this policy setting to associate sites to zones. They are: (1) Intranet zone, (2) Trusted Sites zone, (3) Internet zone, and (4) Restricted Sites zone. Security settings can be set for each of these zones through other policy settings, and their default settings are: Trusted Sites zone (Low template), Intranet zone (Medium-Low template), Internet zone (Medium template), and Restricted Sites zone (High template). (The Local Machine zone and its locked down equivalent have special security settings that protect your local computer.)

If you enable this policy setting, you can enter a list of sites and their related zone numbers. The association of a site with a zone will ensure that the security settings for the specified zone are applied to the site.  For each entry that you add to the list, enter the following information:

Valuename – A host for an intranet site, or a fully qualified domain name for other sites. The valuename may also include a specific protocol. For example, if you enter http://www.contoso.com as the valuename, other protocols are not affected. If you enter just www.contoso.com, then all protocols are affected for that site, including http, https, ftp, and so on. The site may also be expressed as an IP address (e.g., 127.0.0.1) or range (e.g., 127.0.0.1-10). To avoid creating conflicting policies, do not include additional characters after the domain such as trailing slashes or URL path. For example, policy settings for www.contoso.com and www.contoso.com/mail would be treated as the same policy setting by Internet Explorer, and would therefore be in conflict.

Value - A number indicating the zone with which this site should be associated for security settings. The Internet Explorer zones described above are 1-4.

If you disable or do not configure this policy, users may choose their own site-to-zone assignments.</string>
      <string id="IZ_ExplainZoneTemplatesPolicy">This template policy setting allows you to configure policy settings in this zone consistent with a selected security level, for example, Low, Medium Low, Medium, or High.

If you disable this template policy setting, no security level is configured.

If you do not configure this template policy setting, no security level is configured.

Note. Local Machine Zone Lockdown Security and Network Protocol Lockdown operate by comparing the settings in the active URL's zone against those in the Locked-Down equivalent zone. If you select a security level for any zone (including selecting no security), the same change should be made to the Locked-Down equivalent.

Note. It is recommended to configure template policy settings in one Group Policy object (GPO) and configure any related individual policy settings in a separate GPO. You can then use Group Policy management features (for example, precedence, inheritance, or enforce) to apply individual settings to specific targets.</string>

      <string id="IE_ExplainTabProcGrowth">This policy setting allows you to set the rate at which Internet Explorer creates new tab processes. There are two algorithms that Internet Explorer uses.

The default algorithm has four settings: low, medium, high, or default. Low creates very few tab processes; medium creates a moderate amount of tab processes; and high allows the tab process to grow very quickly and is intended only for computers that have ample physical memory. The default setting creates the optimal number of tab processes based on the operating system and amount of physical memory. We recommend the default setting.

The second algorithm must be explicitly enabled through the creation of an integer setting. In this case, each Internet Explorer isolation setting will quickly grow to use the specified integer number of tab processes, regardless of the physical memory on the computer or how many Internet Explorer isolation settings are running.

If you enable this policy setting, you set the rate at which Internet Explorer creates new tab processes to low, medium, or high, or to an integer.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the tab process growth is set to the default. The user can change this value by using the registry key. Note: On Terminal Server, the default value is the integer “1”.</string>
