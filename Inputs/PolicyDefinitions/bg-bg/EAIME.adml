      <string id="L_TurnOnMisconversionLoggingForMisconversionReport">Turn on misconversion logging for misconversion report</string>
      <string id="L_TurnOnMisconversionLoggingForMisconversionReportExplain">This policy setting allows you to turn on logging of misconversion for the misconversion report.

If you enable this policy setting, misconversion logging is turned on.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, misconversion logging is turned off. 

This policy setting applies to Japanese Microsoft IME and Simplified Chinese Microsoft Pinyin.</string>
      <string id="L_TurnOffSavingAutoTuningDataToFile">Turn off saving auto-tuning data to file</string>
      <string id="L_TurnOffSavingAutoTuningDataToFileExplain">This policy setting allows you to turn off saving the auto-tuning result to file.

If you enable this policy setting, the auto-tuning data is not saved to file. 

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, auto-tuning data is saved to file by default.

This policy setting applies to Japanese Microsoft IME only.</string>
      <string id="L_TurnOffHistorybasedPredictiveInput">Turn off history-based predictive input</string>

      <string id="L_TurnOffOpenExtendedDictionaryExplain">This policy setting allows you to turn off Open Extended Dictionary.

If you enable this policy setting, Open Extended Dictionary is turned off. You cannot add a new Open Extended Dictionary.

For Japanese Microsoft IME, an Open Extended Dictionary that is added before enabling this policy setting is not used for conversion.

For Simplified Chinese Microsoft Pinyin, an Open Extended Dictionary that is added before enabling this policy setting is still used for conversion.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Open Extended Dictionary can be added and used by default.

This policy setting is applied to Japanese Microsoft IME and Simplified Chinese Microsoft Pinyin.</string>

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the custom dictionary can be used by default.

For Japanese Microsoft IME, [Clear auto-tuning information] works, even if this policy setting is enabled, and it clears self-tuned words from the custom dictionary.

This policy setting is applied to Japanese Microsoft IME and Simplified Chinese Microsoft Pinyin.</string>
      <string id="L_RestrictCharacterCodeRangeOfConversion">Restrict character code range of conversion</string>
      <string id="L_RestrictCharacterCodeRangeOfConversionExplain">This policy setting allows you to restrict character code range of conversion by setting character filter.

If you enable this policy setting, then only the character code ranges specified by this policy setting are used for conversion of IME.  You can specify multiple ranges by setting a value combined with a bitwise OR of following values:

0x0001 // JIS208 area
0x0002 // NEC special char code
0x0004 // NEC selected IBM extended code
0x0008 // IBM extended code
0x0010 // Half width katakana code
0x0100 // EUDC(GAIJI)
0x0200 // S-JIS unmapped area
0x0400 // Unicode char
0x0800 // surrogate char
0x1000 // IVS char
0xFFFF // no definition.
