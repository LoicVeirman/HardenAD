      <string id="ClearRecentDocsOnExit">Clear history of recently opened documents on exit</string>
      <string id="ClearRecentDocsOnExit_Help">Clear history of recently opened documents on exit.

If you enable this setting, the system deletes shortcuts to recently used document files when the user logs off. As a result, the Recent Items menu on the Start menu is always empty when the user logs on. In addition, recently and frequently used items in the Jump Lists off of programs in the Start Menu and Taskbar will be cleared when the user logs off.

If you disable or do not configure this setting, the system retains document shortcuts, and when a user logs on, the Recent Items menu and the Jump Lists appear just as it did when the user logged off.

Note: The system saves document shortcuts in the user profile in the System-drive\Users\User-name\Recent folder.

Also, see the "Remove Recent Items menu from Start Menu" and "Do not keep history of recently opened documents" policies in this folder. The system only uses this setting when neither of these related settings are selected.

This setting does not clear the list of recent files that Windows programs display at the bottom of the File menu. See the "Do not keep history of recently opened documents" setting.

This policy setting also does not hide document shortcuts displayed in the Open dialog box. See the "Hide the dropdown list of recent files" setting.

This policy also does not clear items that the user may have pinned to the Jump Lists, or Tasks that the application has provided for their menu. See the "Do not allow pinning items in Jump Lists" setting.</string>

If you enable this setting, the Log Off &lt;username&gt; item appears in the Start menu. This setting also removes the Display Logoff item from Start Menu Options. As a result, users cannot remove the Log Off &lt;username&gt; item from the Start Menu.

If you disable this setting or do not configure it, users can use the Display Logoff item to add and remove the Log Off item.

This setting affects the Start menu only. It does not affect the Log Off item on the Windows Security dialog box that appears when you press Ctrl+Alt+Del.

Note: To add or remove the Log Off item on a computer, click Start, click Settings, click Taskbar and Start Menu, click the Start Menu Options tab, and then, in the Start Menu Settings box, click Display Logoff.

      <string id="GreyMSIAds">Gray unavailable Windows Installer programs Start Menu shortcuts</string>
      <string id="GreyMSIAds_Help">Displays Start menu shortcuts to partially installed programs in gray text.

This setting makes it easier for users to distinguish between programs that are fully installed and those that are only partially installed.

Partially installed programs include those that a system administrator assigns using Windows Installer and those that users have configured for full installation upon first use.

      <string id="Intellimenus">Turn off personalized menus</string>
      <string id="Intellimenus_Help">Disables personalized menus.

Windows personalizes long menus by moving recently used items to the top of the menu and hiding items that have not been used recently. Users can display the hidden items by clicking an arrow to extend the menu.

If you enable this setting, the system does not personalize menus. All menu items appear and remain in standard order. Also, this setting removes the "Use Personalized Menus" option so users do not try to change the setting while a setting is in effect.

Note: Personalized menus require user tracking. If you enable the "Turn off user tracking" setting, the system disables user tracking and personalized menus and ignores this setting.

Tip: To Turn off personalized menus without specifying a setting, click Start, click Settings, click Taskbar and Start Menu, and then, on the General tab, clear the "Use Personalized Menus" option.</string>
      <string id="LockTaskbar">Lock the Taskbar</string>
      <string id="LockTaskbar_Help">This setting affects the taskbar, which is used to switch between running applications.

The taskbar includes the Start button, list of currently running tasks, and the notification area. By default, the taskbar is located at the bottom of the screen, but it can be dragged to any side of the screen. When it is locked, it cannot be moved or resized.

If you enable this setting, it prevents the user from moving or resizing the taskbar. While the taskbar is locked, auto-hide and other taskbar options are still available in Taskbar properties.

If you disable this setting or do not configure it, the user can configure the taskbar position.

      <string id="MemCheckBoxInRunDlg_Help">Lets users run a 16-bit program in a dedicated (not shared) Virtual DOS Machine (VDM) process.

All DOS and 16-bit programs run on Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP Professional in the Windows Virtual DOS Machine program. VDM simulates a 16-bit environment, complete with the DLLs required by 16-bit programs. By default, all 16-bit programs run as threads in a single, shared VDM process. As such, they share the memory space allocated to the VDM process and cannot run simultaneously.

Enabling this setting adds a check box to the Run dialog box, giving users the option of running a 16-bit program in its own dedicated NTVDM process. The additional check box is enabled only when a user enters a 16-bit program in the Run dialog box.</string>
      <string id="NoAutoTrayNotify">Turn off notification area cleanup</string>
      <string id="NoAutoTrayNotify_Help">This setting affects the notification area, also called the "system tray."

The notification area is located in the task bar, generally at the bottom of the screen, and it includes the clock and current notifications. This setting determines whether the items are always expanded or always collapsed. By default, notifications are collapsed. The notification cleanup &lt;&lt; icon can be referred to as the "notification chevron."

If you enable this setting, the system notification area expands to show all of the notifications that use this area.

If you disable this setting, the system notification area will always collapse notifications.

If you do not configure it, the user can choose if they want notifications collapsed.</string>

When you hold the cursor over an item on the Start menu or in the notification area, the system displays pop-up text providing additional information about the object.

If you enable this setting, some of this pop-up text is not displayed. The pop-up text affected by this setting includes "Click here to begin" on the Start button, "Where have all my programs gone" on the Start menu, and "Where have my icons gone" in the notification area.

If you disable this setting or do not configure it, all pop-up text is displayed on the Start menu and in the notification area.</string>
      <string id="NoChangeStartMenu">Prevent users from customizing their Start Screen</string>
      <string id="NoChangeStartMenu_Help">This policy setting allows you to prevent users from changing their Start screen layout.

      <string id="ClearTilesOnExit">Clear history of tile notifications on exit</string>
      <string id="ClearTilesOnExit_Help">If you enable this setting, the system deletes tile notifications when the user logs off. As a result, the Tiles in the start view will always show their default content when the user logs on. In addition, any cached versions of these notifications will be cleared when the user logs off.

If you disable or do not configure this setting, the system retains notifications, and when a user logs on, the tiles appear just as they did when the user logged off, including the history of previous notifications for each tile.

This setting does not prevent new notifications from appearing. See the "Turn off Application Notifications" setting to prevent new notifications.</string>
      <string id="StartPinAppsWhenInstalled">Pin Apps to Start when installed</string>

      <string id="LockedStartLayout">Start Screen Layout</string>
      <string id="LockedStartLayout_Help">Specifies the Start screen layout for users.

This setting lets you specify the Start screen layout for users and prevents them from changing its configuration. The Start screen layout you specify must be stored in an XML file that was generated by the Export-StartLayout PowerShell cmdlet.
To use this setting, you must first manually configure a device's Start screen layout to the desired look and feel. Once you are  done, run the Export-StartLayout PowerShell cmdlet on that same device. The cmdlet will generate an XML file representing the layout you configured.

Once the XML file is generated and moved to the desired file path, type the fully qualified path and name of the XML file. You can type a local path, such as C:\StartLayouts\myLayout.xml or a UNC path, such as \\Server\Share\Layout.xml. If the specified file is not available when the user logs on, the layout won't be changed. Users cannot customize their Start screen while this setting is enabled.

If you disable this setting or do not configure it, the Start screen layout won't be changed and users will be able to customize it.</string>

      <string id="NoStartMenuSubFolders_Help">Hides all folders on the user-specific (top) section of the Start menu. Other items appear, but folders are hidden.

This setting is designed for use with redirected folders. Redirected folders appear on the main (bottom) section of the Start menu. However, the original, user-specific version of the folder still appears on the top section of the Start menu. Because the appearance of two folders with the same name might confuse users, you can use this setting to hide user-specific folders.

Note that this setting hides all user-specific folders, not just those associated with redirected folders.

If you enable this setting, no folders appear on the top section of the Start menu. If users add folders to the Start Menu directory in their user profiles, the folders appear in the directory but not on the Start menu.
