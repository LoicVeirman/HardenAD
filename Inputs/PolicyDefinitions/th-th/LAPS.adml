The allowable settings are:

0=Disabled (password will not be backed up)

1=Backup the password to Azure Active Directory

2=Backup the password to Active Directory

If not specified, this setting will default to 0 (Disabled).

      <string id="LAPS_PostAuthenticationActions_Help">This policy configures post-authentication actions which will be executed after detecting an authentication by the managed account.

Grace period: specifies the amount of time (in hours) to wait after an authentication before executing the specified post-authentication actions.

If this setting is enabled and greater than zero, the specified post-authentication actions will be executed upon expiry of the grace period.

If this setting is disabled or not configured, the specified post-authentication actions will be executed after a default 24 hour grace period.

If this setting is equal to zero, no post-authentication actions will be executed.

Actions: specifies the actions to take upon expiry of the grace period.

Reset password: upon expiry of the grace period, the managed account password will be reset.

Reset the password and logoff the managed account: upon expiry of the grace period, the managed account password will be reset and any interactive logon sessions using the managed account will terminated.

(NOTE: after any interactive logon sessions are terminated there may still be other authenticated sessions in use by the managed account. The only robust way to ensure that the previous password is longer in use is to reboot the device.)

Reset the password and reboot: upon expiry of the grace period, the managed account password will be reset and the managed device will be immediately rebooted.

If this setting is disabled or not configured, post-authentication actions will default to "Reset the password and logoff the managed account".

Note: the DSRM account on domain controllers cannot be configured for post-authentication actions. This policy has no effect on domain controllers and will be ignored even if configured for a DC.
