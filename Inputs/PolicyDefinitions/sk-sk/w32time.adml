      <string id="W32TIME_CONFIG_EXPLAIN">This policy setting allows you to specify Clock discipline and General values for the Windows Time service (W32time) for domain controllers including RODCs.

If you enable this policy setting, you can specify the following Clock discipline, General and RODC  parameters for this service.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Windows Time service uses the defaults of each of the following parameters.

Several of the following values are scalar, which means that they only have meaning in relation to one another and are not defined by specific unit measurements.

FrequencyCorrectRate
This parameter controls the rate at which the W32time corrects the local clock's frequency. Lower values cause slower corrections; larger values cause more frequent corrections. Values that are too low can lead to overcorrection and instability. Values that are too high can lead to slow synchronization. Default: 4 (scalar).

HoldPeriod
This parameter indicates how many potentially accurate time samples the client computer must receive in a series before subsequent time samples are evaluated as potential spikes. After a period of not receiving any usable time samples, a time client ceases to evaluate time samples for spikes as soon as the first potentially accurate time sample is received. When a series of time samples (as indicated by HoldPeriod) is received, the time client evaluates subsequent time samples for spikes. A time sample is considered to be a spike when the time difference between a time sample and the client computer's local clock is greater than that of the LargePhaseOffset value. Default: Five time samples.

LargePhaseOffset
This parameter specifies the time variation from the client computer's local clock (phase offset) that a time sample must have to be considered a spike. Time samples that have time variations larger than the LargePhaseOffset value are considered spikes. Default: 50,000,000 100-nanosecond units (ns), which is five seconds.

MaxAllowedPhaseOffset
This parameter controls how W32time corrects the clock based on the size of the calculated time variation between the time sample and the client computer's local clock. If a response is received that has a time variation that is larger than this value, W32time sets the client computer's local clock immediately to the time that is accepted as accurate from the Network Time Protocol (NTP) server. If the time variation is less than this value, the client computer's local clock is corrected gradually. Default: 300 seconds.

MaxNegPhaseCorrection
This parameter controls the maximum allowable clock correction that can be made in a reverse direction. If a time sample is received that indicates a time in the past (as compared to the client computer's local clock) that has a time difference that is greater than the MaxNegPhaseCorrection value, the time sample is discarded. If this happens, the Windows Time source logs an event in the System log of Event Viewer. Default: 172,800 seconds.

MaxPosPhaseCorrection
This parameter controls the maximum allowable clock correction that can be made in a forward direction. If a time sample is received that indicates a time in the future (as compared to the client computer's local clock) that has a time difference greater than the MaxPosPhaseCorrection value, the time sample is discarded. Default: 172,800 seconds.

PhaseCorrectRate
This parameter controls how quickly W32time corrects the client computer's local clock difference to match time samples that are accepted as accurate from the NTP server. Lower values cause the clock to correct more slowly; larger values cause the clock to correct more quickly. Default: 7 (scalar).

PollAdjustFactor
This parameter controls how quickly W32time changes polling intervals. When responses are considered to be accurate, the polling interval lengthens automatically. When responses are considered to be inaccurate, the polling interval shortens automatically. Default: 5 (scalar).

SpikeWatchPeriod
This parameter specifies the amount of time that suspicious time samples are received from a time source before these time samples are accepted as accurate. Time samples are considered suspicious when the time difference between the time sample and the client computer's local clock is larger than the value of LargePhaseOffset. SpikeWatchPeriod is used in conjunction with HoldPeriod to help eliminate sporadic, inaccurate time samples that are returned from a peer. Default: 900 seconds.

UpdateInterval
This parameter specifies the amount of time that W32time waits between corrections when the clock is being corrected gradually. When it makes a gradual correction, the service adjusts the clock slightly, waits this amount of time, and then checks to see if another adjustment is needed, until the correction is finished. Default: 100 1/100th second units, which is 1 second.

General parameters:

AnnounceFlags
This parameter is a bitmask value that controls how time service availability is advertised through NetLogon. Default: 0x0a hexadecimal. See the NtpClient\EventLogFlags Subkey documentation on Microsoft's TechNet Library for possible values.

EventLogFlags
This parameter controls special events that may be logged to the Event Viewer System log. Default: 0x02 hexadecimal bitmask. See the NtpClient\EventLogFlags Subkey documentation on Microsoft's TechNet Library for possible values.

LocalClockDispersion
This parameter indicates the maximum error in seconds that is reported by the NTP server to clients that are requesting a time sample. (Applies only when the NTP server is using the time of the local CMOS clock.) Default: 10 seconds.

MaxPollInterval
This parameter controls the maximum polling interval, which defines the maximum amount of time between polls of a peer. Default: 10 in log base-2, which is 1,024 seconds. (Should not be set higher than 15.)

MinPollInterval
This parameter controls the minimum polling interval that defines the minimum amount of time between polls of a peer. Default: 6 in log base-2, which is 64 seconds.

RequireSecureTimeSyncRequests
This parameter controls whether or not the the DC will respond to time sync requests that use older authentication protocols. If enabled (set to 1), the DC will not respond to requests using such protocols. Default: 0 Boolean.

RODC parameters:

ChainEntryTimeout
This parameter specifies the maximum amount of time that an entry can remain in the chaining table before the entry is considered to be expired. Expired entries may be removed when the next request or response is processed. Default: 16 seconds.

ChainMaxEntries
This parameter controls the maximum number of entries that are allowed in the chaining table. If the chaining table is full and no expired entries can be removed, any incoming requests are discarded. Default: 128 entries.

ChainMaxHostEntries
This parameter controls the maximum number of entries that are allowed in the chaining table for a particular host. Default: 4 entries.

ChainDisable
This parameter controls whether or not the chaining mechanism is disabled. If chaining is disabled (set to 0), the RODC can synchronize with any domain controller, but hosts that do not have their passwords cached on the RODC will not be able to synchronize with the RODC. Default: 0 Boolean.

ChainLoggingRate
This parameter controls the frequency at which an event that indicates the number of successful and unsuccessful chaining attempts is logged to the System log in Event Viewer. Default: 30 minutes.

<string id="W32TIME_CONFIGURE_NTPCLIENT_EXPLAIN">This policy setting specifies a set of parameters for controlling the Windows NTP Client.

If you enable this policy setting, you can specify the following parameters for the Windows NTP Client.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the WIndows NTP Client uses the defaults of each of the following parameters.

NtpServer
The Domain Name System (DNS) name or IP address of an NTP time source. This value is in the form of ""dnsName,flags"" where ""flags"" is a hexadecimal bitmask of the flags for that host. For more information, see the NTP Client Group Policy Settings Associated with Windows Time section of the Windows Time Service Group Policy Settings.  The default value is ""time.windows.com,0x09"". 

Type
This value controls the authentication that W32time uses. The default value is NT5DS.

CrossSiteSyncFlags
This value, expressed as a bitmask, controls how W32time chooses time sources outside its own site. The possible values are 0, 1, and 2. Setting this value to 0 (None) indicates that the time client should not attempt to synchronize time outside its site. Setting this value to 1 (PdcOnly) indicates that only the computers that function as primary domain controller (PDC) emulator operations masters in other domains can be used as synchronization partners when the client has to synchronize time with a partner outside its own site. Setting a value of 2 (All) indicates that any synchronization partner can be used. This value is ignored if the NT5DS value is not set. The default value is 2 decimal (0x02 hexadecimal).

ResolvePeerBackoffMinutes
This value, expressed in minutes, controls how long W32time waits before it attempts to resolve a DNS name when a previous attempt failed. The default value is 15 minutes.

ResolvePeerBackoffMaxTimes
This value controls how many times W32time attempts to resolve a DNS name before the discovery process is restarted. Each time DNS name resolution fails, the amount of time to wait before the next attempt will be twice the previous amount. The default value is seven attempts.

SpecialPollInterval
This NTP client value, expressed in seconds, controls how often a manually configured time source is polled when the time source is configured to use a special polling interval. If the SpecialInterval flag is enabled on the NTPServer setting, the client uses the value that is set as the SpecialPollInterval, instead of the MinPollInterval and MaxPollInterval values, to determine how frequently to poll the time source. The default value is 3600 seconds (1 hour).

EventLogFlags
This value is a bitmask that controls events that may be logged to the System log in Event Viewer. Setting this value to 0x1 indicates that W32time will create an event whenever a time jump is detected. Setting this value to 0x2 indicates that W32time will create an event whenever a time source change is made. Because it is a bitmask value, setting 0x3 (the addition of 0x1 and 0x2) indicates that both time jumps and time source changes will be logged.
