      <string id="DisableChangePassword">Remove Change Password</string>

If you enable this policy setting,  the 'Change Password' button on the Windows Security dialog box will not appear when you press Ctrl+Alt+Del.

However, users are still able to change their password when prompted by the system. The system prompts users for a new password when an administrator requires a new password or their password is expiring.</string>

      <string id="DisableLockComputer_Help">This policy setting prevents users from locking the system.

If you enable this policy setting, users cannot lock the computer from the keyboard using Ctrl+Alt+Del.

If you enable this policy setting, users will not be able to access Task Manager. If users try to start Task Manager, a message appears explaining that a policy prevents the action.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users can access Task Manager to  start and stop programs, monitor the performance of their computers, view and monitor all programs running on their computers, including system services, find the executable names of programs, and change the priority of the process in which programs run.</string>
      <string id="NoLogoff">Remove Logoff</string>
