      <string id="AllowDefaultCredentials">Allow delegating default credentials</string>
      <string id="AllowDefaultCredentials_Explain">This policy setting applies to applications using the Cred SSP component (for example: Remote Desktop Connection).

This policy setting applies when server authentication was achieved by using a trusted X509 certificate or Kerberos.

If you enable this policy setting, you can specify the servers to which the user's default credentials can be delegated (default credentials are those that you use when first logging on to Windows).

The policy becomes effective the next time the user signs on to a computer running Windows.

If you disable or do not configure (by default) this policy setting, delegation of default credentials is not permitted to any computer. Applications depending upon this delegation behavior might fail authentication. For more information, see KB.

Note: The "Allow delegating default credentials" policy setting can be set to one or more Service Principal Names (SPNs).  The SPN represents the target server to which the user credentials can be delegated.  The use of a single wildcard character is permitted when specifying the SPN.

For Example:
TERMSRV/host.humanresources.fabrikam.com Remote Desktop Session Host running on host.humanresources.fabrikam.com machine
TERMSRV/* Remote Desktop Session Host running on all machines.
TERMSRV/*.humanresources.fabrikam.com Remote Desktop Session Host running on all machines in .humanresources.fabrikam.com</string>

This policy setting applies when server authentication was achieved via NTLM.

If you enable this policy setting, you can specify the servers to which the user's default credentials can be delegated (default credentials are those that you use when first logging on to Windows).

If you disable or do not configure (by default) this policy setting, delegation of default credentials is not permitted to any machine.

If you enable this policy setting, you can specify the servers to which the user's fresh credentials can be delegated (fresh credentials are those that you are prompted for when executing the application).

If you do not configure (by default) this policy setting, after proper mutual authentication, delegation of fresh credentials is permitted to Remote Desktop Session Host running on any machine (TERMSRV/*).

If you disable this policy setting, delegation of fresh credentials is not permitted to any machine.

      <string id="RestrictedRemoteAdministration">Restrict delegation of credentials to remote servers</string>
      <string id="RestrictedRemoteAdministration_Explain">When running in Restricted Admin or Remote Credential Guard mode, participating apps do not expose signed in or supplied credentials to a remote host. Restricted Admin limits access to resources located on other servers or networks from the remote host because credentials are not delegated. Remote Credential Guard does not limit access to resources because it redirects all requests back to the client device.

Participating apps:
Remote Desktop Client

If you enable this policy setting, the following options are supported:
 
Restrict credential delegation: Participating applications must use Restricted Admin or Remote Credential Guard to connect to remote hosts.
 
Require Remote Credential Guard: Participating applications must use Remote Credential Guard to connect to remote hosts.
 
Require Restricted Admin: Participating applications must use Restricted Admin to connect to remote hosts.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Restricted Admin and Remote Credential Guard mode are not enforced and participating apps can delegate credentials to remote devices.

Note: To disable most credential delegation, it may be sufficient to deny delegation in Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) by modifying Administrative template settings (located at Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\Credentials Delegation).

Note: On Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2, enabling this policy will enforce Restricted Administration mode, regardless of the mode chosen. These versions do not support Remote Credential Guard.

      <string id="AllowProtectedCreds">Remote host allows delegation of non-exportable credentials</string>
      <string id="AllowProtectedCreds_Explain">Remote host allows delegation of non-exportable credentials

When using credential delegation, devices provide an exportable version of credentials to the remote host. This exposes users to the risk of credential theft from attackers on the remote host.

If you enable this policy setting, the host supports Restricted Admin or Remote Credential Guard mode.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Restricted Administration and Remote Credential Guard mode are not supported. User will always need to pass their credentials to the host.</string>
      <string id="AllowEncryptionOracle">Encryption Oracle Remediation</string>
      <string id="AllowEncryptionOracle_Explain">Encryption Oracle Remediation

This policy setting applies to applications using the CredSSP component (for example: Remote Desktop Connection).

Some versions of the CredSSP protocol are vulnerable to an encryption oracle attack against the client.  This policy controls compatibility with vulnerable clients and servers.  This policy allows you to set the level of protection desired for the encryption oracle vulnerability.

If you enable this policy setting, CredSSP version support will be selected based on the following options:

Force Updated Clients: Client applications which use CredSSP will not be able to fall back to the insecure versions and services using CredSSP will not accept unpatched clients. Note: this setting should not be deployed until all remote hosts support the newest version.

Mitigated: Client applications which use CredSSP will not be able to fall back to the insecure version but services using CredSSP will accept unpatched clients. See the link below for important information about the risk posed by remaining unpatched clients.

Vulnerable: Client applications which use CredSSP will expose the remote servers to attacks by supporting fall back to the insecure versions and services using CredSSP will accept unpatched clients.
