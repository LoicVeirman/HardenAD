      <string id="DisallowCpls">Hide specified Control Panel items</string>
      <string id="DisallowCpls_Help">This setting allows you to display or hide specified Control Panel items, such as Mouse, System, or Personalization, from the Control Panel window and the Start screen. The setting affects the Start screen and Control Panel window, as well as other ways to access Control Panel items, such as shortcuts in Help and Support or command lines that use control.exe. This policy has no effect on items displayed in PC settings.

If you enable this setting, you can select specific items not to display on the Control Panel window and the Start screen.

To hide a Control Panel item, enable this policy setting and click Show to access the list of disallowed Control Panel items. In the Show Contents dialog box in the Value column, enter the Control Panel item's canonical name. For example, enter Microsoft.Mouse, Microsoft.System, or Microsoft.Personalization.

Note: For Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and earlier versions of Windows, the module name should be entered, for example timedate.cpl or inetcpl.cpl. If a Control Panel item does not have a CPL file, or the CPL file contains multiple applets, then its module name and string resource identification number should be entered, for example @systemcpl.dll,-1 for System, or @themecpl.dll,-1 for Personalization. A complete list of canonical and module names can be found in MSDN by searching "Control Panel items".

If both the "Hide specified Control Panel items" setting and the "Show only specified Control Panel items" setting are enabled, the "Show only specified Control Panel items" setting is ignored.

Note: The Display Control Panel item cannot be hidden in the Desktop context menu by using this setting. To hide the Display Control Panel item and prevent users from modifying the computer's display settings use the "Disable Display Control Panel" setting instead.

Note: To hide pages in the System Settings app, use the "Settings Page Visibility" setting under Computer Configuration.</string>
      <string id="ForceClassicControlPanel">Always open All Control Panel Items when opening Control Panel</string>
      <string id="ForceClassicControlPanel_Help">This policy setting controls the default Control Panel view, whether by category or icons.

If this policy setting is enabled, the Control Panel opens to the icon view.

If this policy setting is disabled, the Control Panel opens to the category view.

If this policy setting is not configured, the Control Panel opens to the view used in the last Control Panel session.
Note: Icon size is dependent upon what the user has set it to in the previous session.</string>
      <string id="NoControlPanel">Prohibit access to Control Panel and PC settings</string>
      <string id="NoControlPanel_Help">Disables all Control Panel programs and the PC settings app.

This setting prevents Control.exe and SystemSettings.exe, the program files for Control Panel and PC settings, from starting. As a result, users cannot start Control Panel or PC settings, or run any of their items.

This setting removes Control Panel from:
The Start screen
File Explorer

This setting removes PC settings from:
The Start screen
Settings charm
Account picture
Search results

If users try to select a Control Panel item from the Properties item on a context menu, a message appears explaining that a setting prevents the action.</string>
      <string id="RestrictCpls">Show only specified Control Panel items</string>
      <string id="RestrictCpls_Help">This policy setting controls which Control Panel items such as Mouse, System, or Personalization, are displayed on the Control Panel window and the Start screen.

      <string id="SettingsPageVisibility">Settings Page Visibility</string>
      <string id="SettingsPageVisibility_Help">Specifies the list of pages to show or hide from the System Settings app.

This policy allows an administrator to block a given set of pages from the System Settings app. Blocked pages will not be visible in the app, and if all pages in a category are blocked the category will be hidden as well. Direct navigation to a blocked page via URI, context menu in Explorer or other means will result in the front page of Settings being shown instead.

This policy has two modes: it can either specify a list of settings pages to show or a list of pages to hide. To specify a list of pages to show, the policy string must begin with "showonly:" (without quotes), and to specify a list of pages to hide, it must begin with "hide:". If a page in a showonly list would normally be hidden for other reasons (such as a missing hardware device), this policy will not force that page to appear. After this, the policy string must contain a semicolon-delimited list of settings page identifiers. The identifier for any given settings page is the published URI for that page, minus the "ms-settings:" protocol part.

Example: to specify that only the About and Bluetooth pages should be shown (their respective URIs are ms-settings:about and ms-settings:bluetooth) and all other pages hidden:

showonly:about;bluetooth

Example: to specify that only the Bluetooth page (which has URI ms-settings:bluetooth) should be hidden:

hide:bluetooth

      <string id="HideUnsupportedHardwareNotificationsExplain">This policy controls messages which are shown when Windows is running on a device that does not meet the minimum system requirements for this OS version.

If you enable this policy setting, these messages will never appear on desktop or in the Settings app.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, these messages will appear on desktop and in the Settings app when Windows is running on a device that does not meet the minimum system requirements for this OS version.</string>
