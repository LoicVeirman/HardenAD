      <string id="ClassicShell_Help">This setting allows an administrator to revert specific Windows Shell behavior to classic Shell behavior.

If you enable this setting, users cannot configure their system to open items by single-clicking (such as in Mouse in Control Panel). As a result, the user interface looks and operates like the interface for Windows NT 4.0, and users cannot restore the new features. 
Enabling this policy will also turn off the preview pane and set the folder options for File Explorer to Use classic folders view and disable the users ability to change these options.

If you disable or not configure this policy, the default File Explorer behavior is applied to the user.

Note: In operating systems earlier than Windows Vista, enabling this policy will also disable the Active Desktop and Web view. This setting will also take precedence over the "Enable Active Desktop" setting. If both policies are enabled, Active Desktop is disabled.

Also, see the "Disable Active Desktop" setting in User Configuration\Administrative Templates\Desktop\Active Desktop and the "Do not allow Folder Options to be opened from the Options button on the View tab of the ribbon" setting in User Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\File Explorer.</string>

Shortcut files typically include an absolute path to the original target file as well as the relative path to the current target file. When the system cannot find the file in the current target path, then, by default, it searches for the target in the original path. If the shortcut has been copied to a different computer, the original path might lead to a network computer, including external resources, such as an Internet server.

If you enable this policy setting, Windows only searches the current target path. It does not search for the original path even when it cannot find the target file in the current target path.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Windows searches for the original path when it cannot find the target file in the current target path.</string>

      <string id="DisableKnownFolders_DisplayName">Disable Known Folders</string>
      <string id="DisableKnownFolders_ExplainText">This policy setting allows you to specify a list of known folders that should be disabled.  Disabling a known folder will prevent the underlying file or directory from being created via the known folder API.  If the folder exists before the policy is applied, the folder must be manually deleted since the policy only blocks the creation of the folder.

You can specify a known folder using its known folder id or using its canonical name.  For example, the Sample Videos known folder can be disabled by specifying {440fcffd-a92b-4739-ae1a-d4a54907c53f} or SampleVideos.

Note: Disabling a known folder can introduce application compatibility issues in applications that depend on the existence of the known folder.</string>
      <string id="HideContentViewModeSnippets_DisplayName">Turn off the display of snippets in Content view mode</string>
      <string id="HideContentViewModeSnippets_ExplainText">This policy setting allows you to turn off the display of snippets in Content view mode.

If you enable this policy setting, File Explorer will not display snippets in Content view mode.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, File Explorer shows snippets in Content view mode by default.</string>

      <string id="CheckSameSourceAndTargetForFRAndDFS_DisplayName">Verify old and new Folder Redirection targets point to the same share before redirecting</string>
      <string id="CheckSameSourceAndTargetForFRAndDFS_ExplainText">This policy setting allows you to prevent data loss when you change the target location for Folder Redirection, and the new and old targets point to the same network share, but have different network paths.

If you enable this policy setting, Folder Redirection creates a temporary file in the old location in order to verify that new and old locations point to the same network share. If both new and old locations point to the same share, the target path is updated and files are not copied or deleted.  The temporary file is deleted.
 
If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Folder Redirection does not create a temporary file and functions as if both new and old locations point to different shares when their network paths are different.

Note: If the paths point to different network shares, this policy setting is not required.  If the paths point to the same network share, any data contained in the redirected folders is deleted if this policy setting is not enabled.</string>

      <string id="DisableIndexedLibraryExperience_DisplayName">Turn off Windows Libraries features that rely on indexed file data</string>
      <string id="DisableIndexedLibraryExperience_ExplainText">This policy setting allows you to turn off Windows Libraries features that need indexed file metadata to function properly.  If you enable this policy, some Windows Libraries features will be turned off to better handle included folders that have been redirected to non-indexed network locations.
Setting this policy will:
    * Disable all Arrangement views except for "By Folder"
    * Disable all Search filter suggestions other than "Date Modified" and "Size"
    * Disable view of file content snippets in Content mode when search results are returned
    * Disable ability to stack in the Context menu and Column headers
    * Exclude Libraries from the scope of Start search
This policy will not enable users to add unsupported locations to Libraries.

If you enable this policy, Windows Libraries features that rely on indexed file data will be disabled.
If you disable or do not configure this policy, all default Windows Libraries features will be enabled. </string>
      <string id="DisableSearchBoxSuggestions_DisplayName">Turn off display of recent search entries in the File Explorer search box</string>
      <string id="DisableSearchBoxSuggestions_ExplainText">
Disables suggesting recent queries for the Search Box and prevents entries into the Search Box from being stored in the registry for future references.

File Explorer shows suggestion pop-ups as users type into the Search Box.  These suggestions are based on their past entries into the Search Box.

Note: If you enable this policy, File Explorer will not show suggestion pop-ups as users type into the Search Box, and it will not store Search Box entries into the registry for future references.  If the user types a property, values that match this property will be shown but no data will be saved in the registry or re-shown on subsequent uses of the search box.

      <string id="DisableBindDirectlyToPropertySetStorage_DisplayName">Disable binding directly to IPropertySetStorage without intermediate layers.</string>
      <string id="DisableBindDirectlyToPropertySetStorage_ExplainText">
Changes the behavior of IShellFolder::BindToObject for IID_IPropertySetStorage to not bind directly to the IPropertySetStorage implementation, and to include the intermediate layers provided by the Property System.  This behavior is consistent with Windows Vista's behavior in this scenario.

This disables access to user-defined properties, and properties stored in NTFS secondary streams.

      <string id="NoStrCmpLogical_DisplayName">Turn off numerical sorting in File Explorer</string>
      <string id="NoStrCmpLogical_ExplainText">
This policy setting allows you to have file names sorted literally (as in Windows 2000 and earlier) rather than in numerical order. 
If you enable this policy setting, File Explorer will sort file names by each digit in a file name (for example, 111 &lt; 22 &lt; 3).
If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, File Explorer will sort file names by increasing number value (for example, 3 &lt; 22 &lt; 111).

      <string id="IZ_OpenSearchQuery">Allow OpenSearch queries in File Explorer</string>
      <string id="IZ_Explain_OpenSearchQuery">
This policy setting allows you to manage whether OpenSearch queries in this zone can be performed using Search Connectors in File Explorer.  Search Connectors allow rich searching of remote sources from within File Explorer.  Search results will be returned in File Explorer and can be acted upon like local files.

If you enable this policy setting, users can perform OpenSearch queries in this zone using Search Connectors.

If you disable this policy setting, users are prevented from performing OpenSearch queries in this zone using Search Connectors.

If you do not configure this policy setting, users can perform OpenSearch queries in this zone using Search Connectors.

      <string id="IZ_OpenSearchPreview">Allow previewing and custom thumbnails of OpenSearch query results in File Explorer</string>
      <string id="IZ_Explain_OpenSearchPreview">
This policy setting allows you to manage whether a user may preview an item from this zone or display custom thumbnails in the preview pane in File Explorer. While this policy setting usually applies to items returned by OpenSearch queries using Search Connectors (which allow rich searching of remote sources from within the File Explorer), it might affect other items as well that are marked from this zone. For example, some application-specific items such as MAPI (Messaging Application Programming Interface) items that are returned as search results in File Explorer will be affected. MAPI items reside in the Internet zone, so disabling this policy for the Internet zone will prevent the previewing of these items in File Explorer. For the case of custom thumbnails, it is the zone of the thumbnail that is checked, not the zone of item.  Typically these are the same but a source is able to define a specific location of a thumbnail that is different than the location of the item.

If you enable this policy setting, users can preview items and get custom thumbnails from OpenSearch query results in this zone using File Explorer.

If you disable this policy setting, users will be prevented from previewing items and get custom thumbnails from OpenSearch query results in this zone using File Explorer.

If you do not configure this policy setting, users can preview items and get custom thumbnails from OpenSearch query results in this zone using File Explorer.

Changes to this setting may not be applied until the user logs off from Windows.
