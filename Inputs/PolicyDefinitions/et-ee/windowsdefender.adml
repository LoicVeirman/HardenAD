      <string id="AllowFastServiceStartup">Allow antimalware service to startup with normal priority</string>
      <string id="AllowFastServiceStartup_Explain">This policy setting controls the load priority for the antimalware service. Increasing the load priority will allow for faster service startup, but may impact performance.

If you enable or do not configure this setting, the antimalware service will load as a normal priority task.

If you disable this setting, the antimalware service will load as a low priority task.</string>
      <string id="DisableAntiSpyware">Turn off Windows Defender</string>
      <string id="DisableAntiSpyware_Explain">This policy setting turns off Windows Defender.

If you enable this policy setting, Windows Defender does not run, and computers are not scanned for malware or other potentially unwanted software.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, by default Windows Defender runs and computers are scanned for malware and other potentially unwanted software.</string>     
      <string id="DisableLocalAdminMerge">Configure local administrator merge behavior for lists</string>
      <string id="DisableLocalAdminMerge_Explain">This policy setting controls whether or not complex list settings configured by a local administrator are merged with Group Policy settings. This setting applies to lists such as threats and Exclusions.

If you enable or do not configure this setting, unique items defined in Group Policy and in preference settings configured by the local administrator will be merged into the resulting effective policy. In the case of conflicts, Group policy Settings will override preference settings.

If you disable this setting, only items defined by Group Policy will be used in the resulting effective policy. Group Policy settings will override preference settings configured by the local administrator.</string>
      <string id="DisableRoutinelyTakingAction">Turn off routine remediation</string>
      <string id="DisableRoutinelyTakingAction_Explain">This policy setting allows you to configure whether Windows Defender automatically takes action on all detected threats. The action to be taken on a particular threat is determined by the combination of the policy-defined action, user-defined action, and the signature-defined action.

If you enable this policy setting, Windows Defender does not automatically take action on the detected threats, but prompts users to choose from the actions available for each threat.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Windows Defender automatically takes action on all detected threats after a nonconfigurable delay of approximately ten minutes.</string>
      <string id="ProxyBypass">Define addresses to bypass proxy server</string>
      <string id="ProxyBypass_Explain">This policy, if defined, will prevent antimalware from using the configured proxy server when communicating with the specified IP addresses. The address value should be entered as a valid URL.

      <string id="ProxyServer">Define proxy server for connecting to the network</string>
      <string id="ProxyServer_Explain">This policy setting allows you to configure the named proxy that should be used when the client attempts to connect to the network for definition updates and MAPS reporting. If the named proxy fails or if there is no proxy specified, the following settings will be used (in order):
1. Internet Explorer proxy settings
2. Autodetect
3. None

If you enable this setting, the proxy will be set to the specified URL.

If you disable or do not configure this setting, the proxy will be set according to the order specified above.</string>
      <string id="RandomizeScheduleTaskTimes">Randomize scheduled task times</string>
      <string id="RandomizeScheduleTaskTimes_Explain">This policy setting allows you to enable or disable randomization of the scheduled scan start time and the scheduled definition update start time. This setting is used to distribute the resource impact of scanning. For example, it could be used in guest virtual machines sharing a host, to prevent multiple guest virtual machines from undertaking a disk-intensive operation at the same time.

If you enable or do not configure this setting, scheduled tasks will begin at a random time within an interval of 30 minutes before and after the specified start time.

If you disable this setting, scheduled tasks will begin at the specified start time.</string>
      <string id="ServiceKeepAlive">Allow antimalware service to remain running always</string>
      <string id="ServiceKeepAlive_Explain">This policy setting allows you to configure whether or not the antimalware service remains running when antivirus and antispyware definitions are disabled. It is recommended that this setting remain disabled.

If you enable this setting, the antimalware service will always remain running even if both antivirus and antispyware definitions are disabled.

If you disable or do not configure this setting, the antimalware service will be stopped when both antivirus and antispyware definitions are disabled. If the computer is restarted, the service will be started if it is set to Automatic startup. After the service has started, there will be a check to see if antivirus and antispyware definitions are enabled. If at least one is enabled, the service will remain running. If both are disabled, the service will be stopped.</string>
      <string id="Exclusions_Extensions">Extension Exclusions</string>
      <string id="Exclusions_Extensions_Explain">This policy setting allows you specify a list of file types that should be excluded from scheduled, custom, and real-time scanning. File types should be added under the Options for this setting. Each entry must be listed as a name value pair, where the name should be a string representation of the file type extension (such as "obj" or "lib"). The value is not used and it is recommended that this be set to 0.</string>
      <string id="Exclusions_Paths">Path Exclusions</string>
      <string id="Exclusions_Paths_Explain">This policy setting allows you to disable scheduled and real-time scanning for files under the paths specified or for the fully qualified resources specified.

      <string id="Nis_Consumers_IPS_DisableSignatureRetirement">Turn on definition retirement</string>
      <string id="Nis_Consumers_IPS_DisableSignatureRetirement_Explain">This policy setting allows you to configure definition retirement for network protection against exploits of known vulnerabilities. Definition retirement checks to see if a computer has the required security updates necessary to protect it against a particular vulnerability. If the system is not vulnerable to the exploit detected by a definition, then that definition is "retired". If all definitions for a given protocal are retired then that protocol is no longer parsed. Enabling this feature helps to improve performance. On a computer that is up-to-date with all the latest security updates, network protection will have no impact on network performance.

If you enable or do not configure this setting, definition retirement will be enabled.

If you disable this setting, definition retirement will be disabled.</string>
