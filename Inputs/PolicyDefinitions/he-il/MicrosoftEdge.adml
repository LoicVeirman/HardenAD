      <string id="HomePages">Configure Start pages</string>
      <string id="HomePages_Explain">When you enable the Configure Open Microsoft Edge With policy, you can configure one or more Start pages. When you enable this policy, users are not allowed to make changes to their Start pages.

If enabled, you must include URLs to the pages, separating multiple pages using angle brackets in the following format:

      &lt;support.contoso.com&gt;&lt;support.microsoft.com&gt;

If disabled or not configured, the webpages specified in App settings loads as the default Start pages.

Version 1703 or later:
If you do not want to send traffic to Microsoft, enable this policy and use the &lt;about:blank&gt; value, which honors domain- and non-domain-joined devices, when it is the only configured URL.

Version 1809:
If enabled, and you select either Start page, New Tab page, or previous page in the Configure Open Microsoft Edge With policy, Microsoft Edge ignores the Configure Start Pages policy. If not configured or you set the Configure Open Microsoft Edge With policy to a specific page or pages, Microsoft Edge uses the Configure Start Pages policy.

Supported devices: Domain-joined or MDM-enrolled
Related policy:

      <string id="DisableLockdownOfStartPages">Disable lockdown of Start pages</string>

To do this, you must also enable the Configure Start Pages or Configure Open Microsoft With policy. When enabled, all configured start pages are editable. Any Start page configured using the Configure Start pages policy is not locked down allowing users to edit their Start pages.

If disabled or not configured, the Start pages configured in the Configure Start Pages policy cannot be changed and remain locked down.

For example, adding Microsoft.OneNoteWebClipper_8wekyb3d8bbwe;Microsoft.OfficeOnline_8wekyb3d8bbwe  prevents a user from turning off the OneNote Web Clipper and Office Online extension.

When enabled, removing extensions from the list does not uninstall the extension from the user’s computer automatically. To uninstall the extension, use any available enterprise deployment channel.

If you enable the Allow Developer Tools policy, then this policy does not prevent users from debugging and altering the logic on an extension.

      <string id="AllowFlashClickToRun_Explain">

      <string id="AllowCVList_Explain">This policy setting lets you decide whether to use the Microsoft Compatibility List (a Microsoft-provided list that helps sites with known compatibility issues to display properly) in Microsoft Edge. By default, the Microsoft Compatibility List is enabled and can be viewed by visiting about:compat.

If you enable or don’t configure this setting, Microsoft Edge periodically downloads the latest version of the list from Microsoft, applying the updates during browser navigation. Visiting any site on the Microsoft Compatibility List prompts the employee to use Internet Explorer 11, where the site is automatically rendered as though it’s in whatever version of IE is necessary for it to appear properly.

If you disable this setting, the Microsoft Compatibility List isn’t used during browser navigation.</string>

      <string id="AllowTabPreloading">Allow Microsoft Edge to start and load the Start and New Tab page at Windows startup and each time Microsoft Edge is closed</string>

      <string id="ConfigureKioskMode">Configure kiosk mode</string>
      <string id="ConfigureKioskMode_Explain">Configure how Microsoft Edge behaves when it’s running in kiosk mode with assigned access, either as a single app or as one of multiple apps running on the kiosk device. You can control whether Microsoft Edge runs InPrivate full screen, InPrivate multi-tab with limited functionality, or normal Microsoft Edge.

You need to configure Microsoft Edge in assigned access for this policy to take effect; otherwise, these settings are ignored. To learn more about assigned access and kiosk configuration, see “Configure kiosk and shared devices running Windows desktop editions” (https://aka.ms/E489vw).

If enabled and set to 0 (Default or not configured):
- If it’s a single app, it runs InPrivate full screen for digital signage or interactive displays.
- If it’s one of many apps, Microsoft Edge runs as normal.
If enabled and set to 1:
- If it’s a single app, it runs a limited multi-tab version of InPrivate and is the only app available for public browsing. Users can’t minimize, close, or open windows or customize Microsoft Edge, but can clear browsing data and downloads and restart by clicking “End session.” You can configure Microsoft Edge to restart after a period of inactivity by using the “Configure kiosk reset after idle timeout” policy.
- If it’s one of many apps, it runs in a limited multi-tab version of InPrivate for public browsing with other apps. Users can minimize, close, and open multiple InPrivate windows, but they can’t customize Microsoft Edge.</string>
      <string id="ConfigureKioskResetAfterIdleTimeout">Configure kiosk reset after idle timeout</string>
      <string id="ConfigureKioskResetAfterIdleTimeout_Explain">You can configure Microsoft Edge to reset to the configured start experience after a specified amount of idle time. The reset timer begins after the last user interaction. Resetting to the configured start experience deletes the current user’s browsing data.

If enabled, you can set the idle time in minutes (0-1440). You must set the Configure kiosk mode policy to 1 and configure Microsoft Edge in assigned access as a single app for this policy to work. Once the idle time meets the time specified, a confirmation message prompts the user to continue, and if no user action, Microsoft Edge resets after 30 seconds.

If you set this policy to 0, Microsoft Edge does not use an idle timer.

If disabled or not configured, the default value is 5 minutes.

If you do not configure Microsoft Edge in assigned access, then this policy does not take effect.</string>
      <string id="SuppressEdgeDeprecationNotification">Suppress the display of Edge Deprecation Notification</string>
      <string id="SuppressEdgeDeprecationNotification_Explain">You can configure Microsoft Edge to suppress the display of the notification that informs users that support of this version of Microsoft Edge ended on March 9th, 2021. If enabled, the notification will not show.

If disabled or not configured, the notification will show every time Edge is launched. </string>
