This setting prevents users from using Control Panel to change the window border and taskbar color (on Windows 8), glass color (on Windows Vista and Windows 7), system colors, or color scheme of the desktop and windows.

      <string id="CPL_Personalization_EnableScreenSaver_Help">Enables desktop screen savers.

If you disable this setting, screen savers do not run. Also, this setting disables the Screen Saver section of the Screen Saver dialog in the Personalization or Display Control Panel. As a result, users cannot change the screen saver options.

If you do not configure it, this setting has no effect on the system.

If you enable it, a screen saver runs, provided the following two conditions hold: First, a valid screen saver on the client is specified through the "Screen Saver executable name" setting or through Control Panel on the client computer. Second, the screen saver timeout is set to a nonzero value through the setting or Control Panel.

Also, see the "Prevent changing Screen Saver" setting.</string>
      <string id="CPL_Personalization_SetScreenSaver">Force specific screen saver</string>
      <string id="CPL_Personalization_SetScreenSaver_Help">Specifies the screen saver for the user's desktop.

If you enable this setting, the system displays the specified screen saver on the user's desktop. Also, this setting disables the drop-down list of screen savers in the Screen Saver dialog in the Personalization or Display Control Panel, which prevents users from changing the screen saver.

If you disable this setting or do not configure it, users can select any screen saver.

If you enable this setting, type the name of the file that contains the screen saver, including the .scr file name extension. If the screen saver file is not in the %Systemroot%\System32 directory, type the fully qualified path to the file.
