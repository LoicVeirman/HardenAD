## UPDATE LOG v2.9.9 - AUGUST 2024 

** SCRIPT: HardenAD.ps1 ** 
Fixed issue with keypress when confirming the domain information at the begining.

** CONFIG: TasksSequence_HardenAD.xml ** 
1. Settings/OrganizationalUnits
   > Class *HardenAD_ADMIN* 
   >> The OU skeleton has been updated to a new schema. GPO and PAW folders are now separated from Tier ones. 
   >> *Users* and *Groups* OU are now beneath the according *Tier* OU.
   >  
   > Class *HardenAD_PROD-T1and2* 
   >> A new OU named *Exchange* has been added to manage Exchange Object:
   >>>  Exchange  
   >>>    Contacts  
   >>>      DoNotSync  
   >>>    Distribution List  
   >>>      DoNotSync  
   >>>    Resources  
   >>>      DoNotSync  
   >>>    Shared Mailboxes  
   >>>      DoNotSync  
   >>  
   >> The provisioning OU is not part of this class, and no more in a distinct OU.  
   >> The logic behind the synchronization with EntraID has been modified: by default, the following OU will be considerd as syncing to EntraID:  
   >> - Exchange  
   >> - Groups  
   >> - Users  
   >> - Workstations  
   >> whenever an object should not be synced with Entra, the OU *DoNotSync* will be set to not sync them.  
   >  
2. Settings/Translation/WellKnownID  
   > *Authenticated Users* and *Remote Desktop Users* are now part of the translated section (EN-US versus FR-FR)  
   > 3 new variables are now available:  
   > - %OU-ADM-GPO%: refering to the name of the OU containing GPO groups in the *HardenAD_ADMIN* Class.  
   > - %OU-ADM-GPO-APPLY%: refering to the name of the Child OU containing APPLY GPO groups in the *HardenAD_ADMIN* Class.  
   > - %OU-ADM-GPO-DENY%: refering to the name of the Child OU containing DENY GPO groups in the *HardenAD_ADMIN* Class.  
3. Settings/GroupPolicies/GlobalGpoSettings  
   > The section has been simplified to only 2 attributes:  
   > - GroupName: The Group Object name reference. It uses the *translation* and *GPO* sections to compute the group name.  
   > - OU: path to the OU were GPO Groups Apply and Deny should be stored. The script will use *%OU-ADM-GPO-APPLY%* and *%OU-ADM-GPO-DENY%* to complete the path.  

** MODULE: GroupPolicies.psm1 **  
1. Function New-GpoObject  
   > Updated to version 2.3  
   > The module is now able to dynamically position a GPO' group to the proper OU (ex. "ou=Deny,ou=GPO" when this is a deny group)  

** FOLDER: Tools **  
The tools folder is now emphased with 3 new sub-folders:  
- *Scripts Fix* contains routines to quickly resolve issue or bugs prior to a quick fix edition.  
- *Scripts Import* contains routines to quickly import custom data to the configuration files.  
- *Scripts Manage* contains routines to perform maintenance tasks.  
  
The existing scripts has been moved to this nex structure, or simply removed. The folder *KeePass-2.48.1* remains in place.

** FOLDER: Documentation **
This is a new folder intended to add script documentation (markdownb formated). Contains release notes and official documentation.
