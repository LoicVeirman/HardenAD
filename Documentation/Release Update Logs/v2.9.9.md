# UPDATE LOG v2.9.9 - AUGUST 2024 

## **SCRIPT: HardenAD.ps1**  
Fixed issue with keypress when confirming the domain information at the begining.

## **CONFIG: TasksSequence_HardenAD.xml** 
### Settings/OrganizationalUnits  
#### Class *HardenAD_ADMIN* 
The OU skeleton has been updated to a new schema. GPO and PAW folders are now separated from Tier ones. 
**Users** and **Groups** OU are now beneath the according *Tier* OU.
     
#### Class *HardenAD_PROD-T1and2* 
A new OU, named **Exchange**, has been added to manage Exchange.  
The **provisioning** OU is now part of this class, and no more in a distinct OU.  
The logic behind the synchronization with EntraID has been modified. By default, the following OU will be considerd as syncing to EntraID:
> Exchange  
> Groups  
> Users  
> Workstations      
  
whenever an object should not be synced with Entra, the OU *DoNotSync* will be set to not sync them.  
     
### Settings/Translation/WellKnownID  
**Authenticated Users** and **Remote Desktop Users** are now part of the translated section (EN-US versus FR-FR)  .
3 new variables are now available:  
- **%OU-ADM-GPO%**: refering to the name of the OU containing GPO groups in the *HardenAD_ADMIN* Class.  
- **%OU-ADM-GPO-APPLY%**: refering to the name of the Child OU containing APPLY GPO groups in the *HardenAD_ADMIN* Class.  
- **%OU-ADM-GPO-DENY%**: refering to the name of the Child OU containing DENY GPO groups in the *HardenAD_ADMIN* Class.
   
### Settings/GroupPolicies/GlobalGpoSettings  
The section has been simplified to only 2 attributes:  
- **GroupName**: The Group Object name reference. It uses the *translation* and *GPO* sections to compute the group name.  
- **OU**: path to the OU were GPO Groups Apply and Deny should be stored. The script will use *%OU-ADM-GPO-APPLY%* and *%OU-ADM-GPO-DENY%* to complete the path.  

## **MODULES**   
The modules are now formated in a more conventional manner, making them compliant with the microsoft standards.
