# UPDATE LOG v2.9.9 - AUGUST 2024

---

## MODEL

### Administration Computer

The previous administration computer design was not bullet-proof enough to protect admin accounts.
The model has been reviewed to enhance the security model and give more flexibility to IT team.

### Reboot systems

To ensure a proper deployment of the model in your networks, be advised that a reboot of **all systems** is required. Some parameters may not be properly set until then.

### OU Design

New OU model design has been set:

## SCRIPTS

### HardenAD.ps1

Fixed issue with keypress when confirming the domain information at the begining.
Fixed nasty display when confirming domain information.

### Set-PowerShellEvtLogSDDL.ps1

New script added to the NETLOGON share and used by the GPO HAD-PowerShell-Logs to enforce the ACL on the PowerShell Event log.
The script is stored on each system in *%ProgramData%\HardenAD\Set-PowershellEvtLogSDDL*.
The execution log is stored in *%ProgramData%\HardenAD\Logs\Debug_Set-PowershellEvtLogSDDL.log*.
See details in this note on GPO-PowerShell-Logs for knowledge about the way this script is used.

Please be advise that the script perform a check next to the SDDL push over the registry: this test will always failed until the system is rebooted.

## Clear-AdminCount.ps1

New script to hunt for rogue adminCount objects and clear them peacefully.
The script is deployed onto the PDCEmulator and run every sunday at 08AM.

Its purpose is to detect object that have the attribute adminCount not nulled and not being members of one of the protected groups.
Once detected, the object will be sanitized:

- the attribute AdminCount is nulled
- the owner is replaced by the Domain Admins group
- the ntSecurityDescriptor.ACCESS is flushed and replaced by the one from the class object.

All actions are trapped in two locations:

- In the event log Application, through the source *HardenAD_Clear-AdminCount*, where the event ID 65535 notify for a faulty sanitization (error) and the event ID 1024 notify for a successfull sanitization.
- In the file *%programData%/HardenAD/Logs/Debug_Clear-AdminCount.log*, which is complementary to the event log.

Both contains details about the object being modify, specifically its previous ACLs and Owner.

---

## CONFIG

### Configuration_HardenAD.xml

Updated to reflect new files and folders hierarchy in the preflight check list.

### TasksSequence_HardenAD.xml

#### 1. Settings | OrganizationalUnits  
  
All static OU name have been swapped with their corresponding dynamic name.

##### 1.A. Class HardenAD_ADMIN

The OU skeleton has been updated to a new schema. GPO and PAM folders are now separated from Tier ones.  
**Users** and **Groups** OU are now beneath the according *Tier* OU.

##### 1.B. Class HardenAD_PROD-T1and2

A new OU, named **Exchange**, has been added to manage Exchange.  
The **provisioning** OU is now part of this class, and no more in a distinct OU.  
The logic behind the synchronization with EntraID has been modified. By default, the following OU will be considerd as syncing to EntraID:

- Exchange  
- Groups  
- Users  
- Workstations  
  
Whenever an object should not be synced with Entra, the OU *DoNotSync* will be set to not sync them.  
  
#### 2. Settings | Translation | WellKnownID

There is no more needs to manually adapt the regional language to group variables, the script will translate them.
Many new variables are now free to use in translation; see the annexe file *annexe-DynamicVariableList.md* for a complete list.  
  
##### 3. Settings | GroupPolicies | GlobalGpoSettings
  
The section has been simplified to only 2 attributes:  

- **GroupName**: The Group Object name reference. It uses the *translation* and *GPO* sections to compute the group name.  
- **OU**: path to the OU were GPO Groups Apply and Deny should be stored. The script will use *%OU-ADM-GPO-APPLY%* and *%OU-ADM-GPO-DENY%* to complete the path.

The GPO has been updated with a new schedule: every day at 9:53 PM, the script *reconcile-ComputerSDD.ps1* is run.  

The script **reconcile-ComputerSDDL.ps1** will query for computer with a wrong owner (i.e. not Domain Admins) and not part of the *exceptions.csv* file.
The script is present in the folder %WinDir%\HardenAD\ScheduledTasks\Reconcile-ComputerSDDL. The folder contains the script and a csv file.  
If an object computer must be set with a different owner and not modified by the schedule, you need to add the samAccountName of this computer to the **exception.csv** file.

### HAD-PowerShell-Logs

The GPO has been completely rebuild. The scope now concern both user and computer settings, the previous startup scripts has been removed and the function to enforce the ACL on the event log been rewriten.
We also have remove the transcript files generation, as it is not possible to protect them efficently and could contains dangerous information.

The GPO will provide each system with two schedule tasks:

1. **Import HAD Scripts**: run once and imediatly, the task copies the script from the NetLogon share to %ProgramData/HardenAD. Once executed, the tasks is deleted.
2. **Setup PoSh Event log Security**: this task will be run at the end of the execution of the task "Import HAD Scripts". It then start the script that enforce security permissions on *Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational* by copying the ones of Security Event Log. A reboot is required to finalize the process.

The GPO also enforce the transcript for module and script block at system and user side.

### HAD-TS-AdminSDholder-Check

A new GPO that deploy a schedule on the PDC to hunt for rogue AdminCount objects and sanitize them every sunday at 8AM (default behavior: trigger disabled)
The GPO uses the script "Clear-AdminCount.ps1" located in %ProgramData%\HardenAD\Clear-AdminCount (refers to it for details). The deployment process is:

1. Create folder %ProgramData%\HardenAD\Clear-AdminCount
2. Create folder %ProgramData%\Microsoft\Event Viewer\Views\Harden AD
3. Copy *Clear-AdminCount.ps1* from \\domain\netlogon\HAD\Clear-Admincount to %ProgramData%\HardenAD\Clear-AdminCount
4. Copy *View_Clear-AdminCount.xml* from \\domain\netlogon\HAD\Clear-Admincount to %ProgramData%\Microsoft\Event Viewer\Views\Harden AD
5. Create a scheduled task *HardenAD\clear Rogue AdminCount Object* and set it up to run every sunday at 8am (trigger is disabled by default)

Note: be advised that the script will create the folder *Logs* if this one is not present in %ProgramData%\HardenAD.

The trigger is disabled by default to avoid issue in production. Prior to automatically run this task, you must review every object with an AdminCount not null and ensure that the cleareance of the owner and the security access rules will not break application or services in your production. To identify which objects will be cleared out, run the below command:

```POWERSHELL  
$accountsList = Get-ADObject -filter 'AdminCount -eq 1 -and isCriticalsystemObject -notlike "*"' -properties *  
$adminGroupList = get-adgroup  -filter 'admincount -eq 1 -and iscriticalsystemobject -like "*"' | Select-Object -ExpandProperty distinguishedName  
$result = @()  
$accountsList | % {  
    $isMbrOf = Get-AdGroup -Filter { member -recursiveMatch $_.DistinguishedName }  
    $isAdmin = $false  
    foreach ($grp in $isMbrOf) {  
        if ($adminGroupList.contains($grp.distinguishedName)) {  
            $isAdmin = $true  
        }  
    }  
    if (-not($isAdmin)) {  
        $result += $_  
    }  
}  
$Result | FT sAMAccountName,Name,DistinguishedName  
``

### HAD-TS-Local-Admins-Groups

The GPO has been completly refreshed. the new design no more require a reboot to enable the scripts and the sequence to update some files prior to add the GPO have been removed.
The new process is:

1. Enable Advanced Audit Logs (Audit Computer Account Management, Audit Directory Service Access and Audit Directory Service Changes)
2. Create folder %ProgramData%\HardenAD\Set-LocalAdminGroups
3. Create folder %ProgramData%\Microsoft\Event Viewer\Views\Harden AD
4. Create folder %ProgramData%\HardenAD\Logs
5. Create folder %ProgramData%\HardenAD\HardenAD\Configuration
6. Copy all files from \\domain\sysvol\domain\HardenAD\Configuration to %ProgramData%\HardenAD\Configuration
7. Copy all files from \\domain\netlogon\HAD\Set-LocalAdminGroups to %ProgramData%\HardenAD\Set-LocalAdminGroups
8. Copy *View_Clear-LocalAdminGroups.xml* from \\domain\netlogon\HAD\Set-LocalAdminGroups to %ProgramData%\Microsoft\Event Viewer\Views\Harden AD
9. Copy *View_Set-LocalAdminGroups.xml* from \\domain\netlogon\HAD\Set-LocalAdminGroups to %ProgramData%\Microsoft\Event Viewer\Views\Harden AD
10. Create scheduled task *HardenAD\Local Admin Groups - Clear* and set it up to run every hour
11. Create scheduled task *HardenAD\Local Admin Groups - Fix* and set it up to run at 6am and 8pm.
12. Create scheduled task *HardenAD\Local Admin Groups - Set* and set it up to run on event detection (modify, create or delete a computer object)

The *Clear* process will hunt to orphaned groups (i.e. belonging computer object not existing).
The *Fix* process will hunt to orphaned computers (i.e. belonging group object is not existing).
The *Set* proccss will hunt to computer object activity on AD.
